## A (Swift) attempt at the Programming with Categories problem sets.

👋🏽 Here’s my attempt at the problems sets from Fong, Milewski, and Spivak’s ’[20 IAP course](http://brendanfong.com/programmingcats.html) (18.S097).

I’ve translated all Haskell-related questions to Swift—leaning on [Bow](https://bow-swift.io) in the process for its Prelude and the likely need for [HKT emulation](https://bow-swift.io/docs/fp-concepts/higher-kinded-types/) in later problem sets.

If you find any mistakes, typos, or ways I can typeset better—it’s been years since my undergraduate TeX days—please feel free to open an issue, PR, or let me know [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jasdev).
